# Chest-X-Ray-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-Models

## Abstract

We are well aware of how bacteria and viruses like covid-19 and pneumonia can cause serious damage to our lungs. When a patient has a lung infection, one of the first tests performed at the hospital is a chest X-ray. With the use of AI, the healthcare system can be enhanced to better serve a large number of people. Machine Learning models can be trained to classify and detect infections in our lungs using chest x-rays and radiographs. Our project's goal is to use Convolutional Neural Network models to detect infections such as Covid-19 and Pneumonia in chest x-ray images. The project will also compare two widely used CNN models, VGG-19, and ResNet-50.

## Data

Lung infections can be analyzed through chest x-rays or chest radiographs. The dataset for this project is taken from Kaggle. The Kaggle dataset consists of chest x-ray images. There are three sub-categories of chest x-rays in the dataset. They are – 
COVID-19 chest x-rays – 1626 images
Pneumonia chest x-rays – 1800 images
Normal chest x-rays – 1802 images
These three types of chest x-ray images can be used to train the CNN model. This trained CNN model can predict the test data accordingly.

## Results

The VGG-19 and the Resnet-50 models have classified chest x-rays. For the VGG-19 Models, the accuracy is recorded as – 98.85 percent for COVID-19 and normal images, and 92.11 percent for Pneumonia and normal images. For the ResNet-50 model, an accuracy of 96.19% was recorded for COVID-19 and normal images, and 89.66% for pneumonia and normal images. VGG-19 model recorded the highest accuracy for COVID-19 as well as Pneumonia cases. We can conclude that the VGG-19 model works best for our problem statement and data.
